[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an end-to-end open source platform
for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of
[tools](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/tools),
[libraries](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/libraries-extensions), and
[community](https://www.tensorflow.org/community) resources that lets
researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and
deploy ML-powered applications.

TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the
Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization to
conduct machine learning and deep neural networks research.
